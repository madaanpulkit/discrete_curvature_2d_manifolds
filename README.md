# discrete_curvature_2d_manifolds
This is a python implementation of  the paper ''Discrete Differential-Geometry Operators for Triangulated 2-Manifolds'' (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-05105-4_2)

This contains a python notebook for interactive understanding. OFF files can be loaded from the 'Main' cell.

In order to run the python file
```
python discrete_curvature.py file_path
```
where file_path is the path of the OFF triangulated mesh file.

The generated curvatures for each vertex are stored in .npy files.
Sample OFF files are uploaded for trials in the samples folder.

For now plotting can be done via the plot.py file in the repo https://github.com/Pranav-Jain/Curvatures-of-Triangulated-2-Manifolds can be used. Be careful of the file names it requires.
In repo plot support coming soon.
